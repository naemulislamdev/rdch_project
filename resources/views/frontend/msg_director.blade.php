                        <p>I feel immense pleasure in transforming my dream of establishing a world class private medical college in reality. My vision is to make it a center of excellence for health education where students from any country become Bachelor of Dental Surgery (BDS) and Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) doctor in true sense. Now a days everyone is much concern about their own health. But doctor-patient ratio is still far from adequate in this country of 150 million people. Our aim is to produce BDS and MBBS physicians dedicated for the service of the society so that the health education and services may become more practical & with human values. At the college, care will be taken at the highest level to ensure that students are provided with all necessary amenities and encouraging learning environment which is essential for their healthy & steady growth. As a Managing Director (MD) of these college, I shall make my best efforts to evolve this college into the one that will set a benchmark for itself and also enrich the quality of health sciences in this country. Iâ€™m confident that the team of faculty & staffs of this dental and medical college and the budding students will work with absolute dedication to fulfill these expectations and in converting my vision into reality. At last I pray to Almighty ALLAH may give us patience & strength to raise this institute to one of the best in this country as well as in the world.</p>
